The creators of the Immich photo hosting app have a page for [Cursed Knowledge](https://immich.app/cursed-knowledge/) and the concept really resonated with me. In particular two really stood out, the JavaScript Dates indexing, and the Cloudflare workers redirect loop problem. I have without any shame ripped off that concept and intend to add to it as I go along in my journey.
