My collegue Dan Yip and I will be talking at the Leeds AWS User Group on 'Why you are doing Lambda functions wrong'

> Clickbait titles aside; some experimentation and recap of common microservice architectural decisions we’ve seen teams and engineers making. Some consciously and some without realising the alternative approaches.
> We’ll cover some of those misconceptions and the results of a small scale experimentation we conducted with some results we found interesting.
