I've been working in the IT field for the last 15+ years starting out as a field support engineer, through that time I have gained varied experience across a number of verticals and managed implementations from pre-sales through delivery and completion.

I'm a committed, reliable and adaptable technical lead with extensive Cloud, Virtualisation, Windows, Linux, and networking experience. I'm quick to assimilate new ideas, concepts and practices with excellent communication and interpersonal skills.
