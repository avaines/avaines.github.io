I'll be talking at this year's Leeds Digitial Festival; We've taught Microsoft's AI and ML services to play the ITV classic, Catchphrase.

> Join [BJSS]() and guests from [ITV](https://www.linkedin.com/company/itv/) in this exclusive evening of food, drinks, entertainment and demos all focused on how AI can free up time, resources, and budget to optimise your business operations.
>
> We will be:
> ➡️ Sharing practical techniques for building and integrating AI-based software
> ➡️ Bringing iconic ITV footage to life using AI.
> ➡️ Putting our 'Catchphrase' AI model to the test against a live studio audience!
