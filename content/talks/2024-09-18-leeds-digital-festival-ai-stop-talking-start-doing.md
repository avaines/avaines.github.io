I spoke at and helped design a workshop for this years Leeds Digital Festival; everyone seems to be talking about AI but very little actual hands on opportunities are available for engineers to get down and dirty with the services.

> Dive into AI with our hands-on workshop. Build a knowledge 
> management tool to boost productivity, demo new AI tools, and enhance 
> workflows.
