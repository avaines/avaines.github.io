I'll be talking at the upcoming Nottingham's TechFast on the 15th of May 2024 on an entirely unexpected topic of Serverless, Lambdas & Terraform (unless you've heard me talk before, in which case it's quite expected).

> "Buckle up for a wild ride through the jungle of AWS lambda function packaging patterns. Serverless can be like a treacherous path in the wilderness, leading you astray. Don your explorer's hat and let's discover the mysterious secrets of efficient serverless deployments!"
