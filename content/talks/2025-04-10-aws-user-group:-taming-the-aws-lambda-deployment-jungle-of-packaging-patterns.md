A talk so good, I'm [doing it again](../2024-04-24-notts-techfast:-taming-the-aws-lambda-deployment-jungle-of-packaging-patterns.md)! this time at the Leeds & Your AWS User Group, hosted by [Burendo](https://burendo.com/) on the 10th of April 2025 on an entirely unexpected topic of Serverless, Lambdas & Terraform (unless you've heard me talk before, in which case it's quite expected).

> "Buckle up for a wild ride through the jungle of AWS lambda function packaging patterns. Serverless can be like a treacherous path in the wilderness, leading you astray. Don your explorer's hat and let's discover the mysterious secrets of efficient serverless deployments!"
